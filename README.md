# MachineLEarning_GroupAssignment
An assignment for Machine Learning
It was a project to model baby birthweight based on various parametres, some coming from parents lifestyle, some coming from demographic and inheritable characters. The data set for the excercise is available in Data2 folder with name birthweight_feature_set.xlsx


![](/Data2/birthweight_feature_set.xlsx)

After data cleaning Various models were created using logistic regression, KNN, Cross Validation. With the excercise, our focus was to determine how differnet models behave to the data set and find out the best model for the given data set.
